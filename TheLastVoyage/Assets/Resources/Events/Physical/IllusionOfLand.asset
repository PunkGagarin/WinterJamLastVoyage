  <gameEventText>k__BackingField: While sailing, the crew spots what appears to be
    land on the horizon. However, upon closer inspection, it turns out to be an optical
    illusion caused by weather conditions or the crew's exhaustion. You must decide
    whether to investigate or continue on your journey.
  <acceptButtonText>k__BackingField: Investigate
  <rejectButtonText>k__BackingField: Ignore
  <acceptedText>k__BackingField: 'You decide to investigate, you order the ship to
    change course and head towards the supposed land. However, after wasting time
    and resources, it turns out to be an illusion and the crew becomes disappointed
    and morale drops. '
  <rejectedText>k__BackingField: You decide to continue on your original course,
    knowing that it's an optical illusion and not wasting time and resources. The
    crew may be disappointed but at least the journey continues with no significant
    losses.
