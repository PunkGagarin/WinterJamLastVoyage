    of sea life, such as fish, whales, and dolphins. You must decide whether to take
    advantage of this opportunity or continue on your journey.

    could also lead to overfishing or hunting, which could have a negative impact
    on the sea life and the environment.

    that it's not necessary or it's too risky to take advantage of this opportunity.
