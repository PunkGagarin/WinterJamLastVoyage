  <baseEventType>k__BackingField: 0
  <gameEventText>k__BackingField: While sailing, the crew spots a massive sea creature,
    possibly a giant squid or a whale, swimming near the ship. You must decide whether
    to investigate or avoid the creature.
  <acceptButtonText>k__BackingField: Investigate
  <rejectButtonText>k__BackingField: Ignore
  <acceptedText>k__BackingField: You decide to investigate, you order the ship to
    get closer to the creature, in order to study it or even hunt it. However, this
    could lead to the ship being damaged, or the crew being injured, by the powerful
    creature's attacks.
  <rejectedText>k__BackingField: You decide to avoid the creature, you order the
    ship to change course and steer away from it. This may prevent the ship and crew
    from being damaged, but also miss the opportunity to study or hunt the creature.
