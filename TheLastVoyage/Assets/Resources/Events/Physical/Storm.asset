  <gameEventText>k__BackingField: A severe storm hits your ship, with winds howling
    and waves crashing against the hull. Your crew struggles to keep the ship steady
    as the storm rages on. Hunger levels increase rapidly and the ship's health is
    at risk. You must decide whether to ride out the storm, risking further damage
    but keeping the crew safe, or try to outrun it, saving time but risking more
    damage and increasing hunger levels. Your decision will affect the ship's health,
    crew's morale and your time to reach the safe port before the ship sinks.
  <acceptButtonText>k__BackingField: Ride

  <acceptedText>k__BackingField: You decide to ride out the storm, causing some damage
    but keeping the crew safe. Hunger levels increase, but the crew's morale improves
    as they feel safe and secure. However, the storm takes time, and you must now
    repair the ship and find food and water to restore the crew's energy.
  <rejectedText>k__BackingField: You decide to outrun the storm, saving time and
    resources but causing damage and increasing hunger levels. Ship is able to avoid
    more severe damage and you can reach the safe port faster.
