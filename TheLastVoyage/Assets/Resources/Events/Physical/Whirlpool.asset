  <baseEventType>k__BackingField: 0
  <gameEventText>k__BackingField: While sailing, the crew spots a massive whirlpool
    in the water ahead. It poses a significant danger to the ship and the crew. You
    must decide whether to attempt to navigate through it or avoid it.
  <acceptButtonText>k__BackingField: Navigate
  <rejectButtonText>k__BackingField: Avoid
  <acceptedText>k__BackingField: You decide to attempt to navigate through it, you
    order the crew to take the necessary precautions and use all the ship's power
    to try to navigate the ship through the whirlpool. However, this could lead to
    the ship being damaged or capsized, and the crew being injured or lost.
  <rejectedText>k__BackingField: You decide to avoid it, you order the ship to change
    course and steer away from it. This may prevent the ship and crew from being
    damaged, but also might make the journey longer and consume more resources.
