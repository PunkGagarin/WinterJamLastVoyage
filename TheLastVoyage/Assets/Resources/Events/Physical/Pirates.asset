  <gameEventText>k__BackingField: While sailing, you spot a ship on the horizon,
    as it gets closer, you realize that it's a pirate ship. The pirates are known
    for their ruthless tactics and they will stop at nothing to get what they want.
    You must decide whether to engage in battle with the pirates or try to outrun
    them.
  <acceptButtonText>k__BackingField: Fight
  <rejectButtonText>k__BackingField: Run
  <acceptedText>k__BackingField: You decide to engage in battle with the pirates,
    you order your crew to prepare for battle and you arm yourself. The battle is
    intense, but your crew is well-trained and determined, and you manage to defeat
    the pirates. However, the battle takes time, and the ship takes damage, so you
    must now repair the ship and restore the crew's morale.
  <rejectedText>k__BackingField: ou decide to outrun the pirates, you order your
    crew to set a course that will take you away from the pirate ship. The pirates
    give chase, but your ship is faster and you manage to escape. However, you lose
    time and resources in the process, and the crew's morale is affected by the close
    call with the pirates.
