  <baseEventType>k__BackingField: 0
  <gameEventText>k__BackingField: Your ship is running low on food supplies and the
    crew is starting to feel the effects of hunger. You must decide how to handle
    the situation, as the food shortage can affect the crew's health, morale, and
    your journey.
  <acceptButtonText>k__BackingField: Find food
  <rejectButtonText>k__BackingField: Ignore
  <acceptedText>k__BackingField: You decide to take immediate action to find more
    food. You order the crew to ration the food supplies, and you start searching
    for food sources, such as nearby islands or passing ships. You also order the
    crew to hunt for food, fish and gather fruits and nuts if possible. Your decision
    takes time and resources, but it prevents the crew from starving and keeps the
    crew healthy.
  <rejectedText>k__BackingField: You decide to ignore the problem and hope that it
    will go away on its own. But the food supplies continue to decrease, and the
    crew's hunger level increases. You must now deal with the consequences of your
    inaction, and try to find food, but it will take more time and resources, and
    the morale of the crew is affected. Additionally, the ship's navigation and safety
    are compromised.
