  <gameEventText>k__BackingField: A fire breaks out on the ship, caused by a malfunction
    or human error. The flames are quickly spreading and the heat is intense. You
    must decide how to handle the situation, as the fire can affect the ship's health,
    the crew's morale, and your journey.
  <acceptButtonText>k__BackingField: Action
  <rejectButtonText>k__BackingField: Ignore
  <acceptedText>k__BackingField: You decide to take immediate action to put out the
    fire. You order the crew to use the ship's fire extinguishers and to form a bucket
    brigade. You also order the crew to evacuate the affected areas and to take safety
    measures. Your decision takes time and resources, but it prevents the fire from
    spreading further and keeps the ship and the crew safe.
  <rejectedText>k__BackingField: You decide to ignore the problem and hope that it
    will go away on its own. But the fire continues to spread, affecting more and
    more areas of the ship. You must now deal with the consequences of your inaction,
    and try to put out the fire, but it will take more time and resources, and the
    morale of the crew is affected.
