    are discontent with the way things are going. They are starting to question your
    decisions and your ability to lead. Rumors of mutiny are circulating among the
    crew. You must decide how to handle this situation before it escalates.
  <acceptButtonText>k__BackingField: Speak
  <rejectButtonText>k__BackingField: Ignore
  <acceptedText>k__BackingField: You decide to address the issue head-on, you call
    a meeting with your crew and you listen to their complaints and concerns. You
    assure them that you are doing your best to keep them safe and to reach the safe
    port. You promise to take their suggestions and feedback into account. You also
    remind them of the danger of mutiny and the consequences of their actions. Your
    crew calms down and their morale improves but it takes time to repair the relationship.
