  <baseEventType>k__BackingField: 0
  <gameEventText>k__BackingField: Your ship encounters a period of favorable weather
    conditions, with strong winds blowing in the direction of your destination. This
    can speed up your journey and reduce the risk of hazards.
  <acceptButtonText>k__BackingField: Catch Wind
  <rejectButtonText>k__BackingField: Ignore
  <acceptedText>k__BackingField: You decide to take advantage of the fair winds and
    set the sails to catch the wind. The ship makes good progress and the journey
    becomes faster and smoother. However, there is a risk of overworking the crew
    and overusing the ship's resources.
  <rejectedText>k__BackingField: You decide to play it safe and keep the ship's current
    course and speed. The journey may take longer but it will be safer for the ship
    and the crew. However, the opportunity to make good progress is lost.
