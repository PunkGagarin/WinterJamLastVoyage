  <gameEventText>k__BackingField: our ship is hit by a prolonged period of dry weather,
    the water sources are scarce and the crew is running low on water. You must decide
    how to handle the situation, as the drought can affect the crew's health and
    well-being.
  <acceptButtonText>k__BackingField: Search
  <rejectButtonText>k__BackingField: Ignore
  <acceptedText>k__BackingField: You decide to take immediate action to find fresh
    water. You order the crew to ration the water supplies, and you start searching
    for a freshwater source. You also enforce strict hygiene measures, such as frequent
    hand washing, and you remind the crew to conserve water. Your decision takes
    time and resources, but it prevents the crew from dehydrating and keeps the crew
    healthy.
  <rejectedText>k__BackingField: You decide to ignore the problem and hope that it
    will go away on its own. But the drought continues and the water supplies are
    running low. You must now deal with the consequences of your inaction, and try
    to find fresh water, but it will take more time and resources, and the morale
    of the crew is affected.
