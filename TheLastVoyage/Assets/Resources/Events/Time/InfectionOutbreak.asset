  <baseEventType>k__BackingField: 0
  <gameEventText>k__BackingField: An infection outbreak occurs on the ship, affecting
    the health of the crew. Symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
    You must decide how to handle the situation, as the infection can spread rapidly
    and affect the crew's ability to navigate the ship.
  <acceptButtonText>k__BackingField: Contain
  <rejectButtonText>k__BackingField: Ignore
  <acceptedText>k__BackingField: You decide to take immediate action to contain the
    infection. You order the affected crew members to be quarantined, and you start
    searching for a cure. You also enforce strict hygiene measures, such as frequent
    hand washing, and you isolate the infected members of the crew. Your decision
    takes time and resources, but it prevents the infection from spreading further
    and keeps the crew healthy.
  <rejectedText>k__BackingField: You decide to ignore the problem and hope that it
    will go away on its own. But the infection spreads rapidly, affecting more and
    more crew members, and it starts to affect the ship's navigation. You must now
    deal with the consequences of your inaction, and try to contain the infection,
    but it will take more time and resources, and the morale of the crew is affected.
